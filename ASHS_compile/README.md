The goal of ASHS compile is to amalgamate the final hippocampal subfields output as well as intracranial volume from ASHS into a single csv file.

There are two codes:
1) ASHS_compile_v1_05072023.py - does the amalgation described above
2) ASHS_VQC2removevalues.sps - based on whether each subfield passed VQC - yes(1) and no (0), it will remove value and replace them with '777'.
